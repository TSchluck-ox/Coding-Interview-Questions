Question from 10/08

Create a program that takes a message from stdin in digits eg. '12256391' and prints how many possible
different intepretations it can be of the numbers 1 to 26 representing alphabetic chars.

Ex. 123
can be 1, 2, 3 = abc
12, 3 = lc
1, 23 = aw
so 3 total readings

Ex. 1234
can be 1,2,3,4; 12,3,4; 1,23,4;
so 3 total readings
